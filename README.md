## Description

The FXMachine Expert Advisor is a fully automated trading system designed to execute buy and sell orders in the foreign exchange market. It uses technical analysis to identify optimal trade entry and exit points based on the current market conditions.

## How it Works

The Expert Advisor uses the MetaTrader 5 platform and the MQL5 programming language. It includes the necessary libraries for trading operations and retrieving symbol information.

### Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the trade and symbol objects are initialized. The expert magic number is set, which is used to identify the trades executed by the Expert Advisor. The necessary trading parameters such as slippage, stop loss, and take profit levels are also set.

### Trading Logic

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. It first checks if there are any open positions. If there are, it monitors them and adjusts the stop loss and take profit levels if needed.

If there are no open positions, it proceeds to identify the optimal trade entry and exit points. The current Ask price is used as the entry price, and the current Bid price is used as the exit price. The position size is calculated based on the available margin and a risk percentage.

Finally, the Expert Advisor executes the buy and sell orders using the calculated position size, entry price, and exit price.

### Position Size Calculation

The `CalculatePositionSize()` function calculates the position size based on the available margin and a risk percentage. It retrieves the account balance and calculates the margin required for the trade. The maximum risk is calculated based on the account balance and risk percentage. The position size is then calculated by dividing the maximum risk by the margin.

### Deinitialization

In the `OnDeinit()` function, a report on trading performance and results is generated. It retrieves the total profit and total balance, and calculates the drawdown percentage.
